**PaPy** - Parallel Pipelines in Python
=======================================

This documentation covers the implementation and usage of *PaPy*. It consists of a
hand-written manual and an API-reference. Please refer also to the comments in
the source code.

.. warning::

  **parallel features of** *PaPy* **do not work in the interactive interpreted**
  
  Code snippets, examples and use cases are not meant to be typed into the 
  interactive interpreter console. They should be run from the command line
  (this is a limitation of the ``multiprocessing`` module)::
  
    $ python example_file.py

  The relevant files are available in the doc directory of the source-code
  repository.

  Functions defined in the interactive interpreter will not work (and will hang
  Python) if used with *IMap* instances!  A python function can only be
  communicated to multiple processes if it can be serialized(i.e. pickled) this
  is not possible if the function is in the same namespace as a child process
  (created using the multiprocessing library).
 
  **The interpreter will hang on exit if a pipeline does not finish or is halted
  abnormaly***
  
  The Python interpreter exits (returns) if all spawned threads or forked
  processes return. *PaPy* uses multiple threads to manage the pipeline and
  evaluates functions in seperate threads or processes. All of them need to be
  stopped before the parent python process can return. This is done
  automatically whenever a pipeline finishes or some expected exception occurs,
  in all other cases it is required that the user stops the pipeline manually.
