**PaPy** for Bioinformatics
###########################

**PaPy** makes it easier to create bioinformatics workflows in a 
semi-standardized manner by using data-containers for biological
data. These containers are specialized sub-classes of typed ``NuBoxes``
and are available ``nubio`` packacge, please refer to the ``NuBio`` 
documentation to learn about bioinformatics data-containers utility functions 
and to the ``nubox`` documentation for the hierarchical ``NuBox`` 
data-structure.
