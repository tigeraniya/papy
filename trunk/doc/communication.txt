Communication
=============

This chapter deals with the details of inter-process communication in *PaPy*.
By it's design *PaPy* is a rather high-level engine for the execution of
chained tasks and the details of inter-process communication (



By
default pipers are connected by a pair of locked pipe objects. This is
inefficient as it involves two passes of pickling/unpickling and creates a
potential bottleneck as half of all computations is done by a single process.
The solution is to either a) bypass the double pipe connection and connect piper
processes directly, b) use a more efficient serialization protocol.
