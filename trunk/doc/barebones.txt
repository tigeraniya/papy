====================================
The most barebones parallel pipeline
====================================

In this example we construct a data processing pipeline using different imap
implementations. Making it easy to construct such pipelines is the task of papy,
but here we do it manually. The working code can be found in
doc/barebones/barebones.py, please keep in mind that the code samples in this
section will not work when pasted to the interactive interpreter. This is
because of the limitations of the multiprocessing module.
