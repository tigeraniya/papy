Use case 1: Protein theoretical model refinement.
=================================================

This use case is a quite complex computational structural biology workflow 
expressed as a PaPy pipeline. This pipeline processes batches of homology models
downloaded from the Database of Comparative Protein Structure Models
(ModBase). It's task is to energy-minimize and refine these theoretical
structures by means of parallel molecular dynamics(MD) simulations.
